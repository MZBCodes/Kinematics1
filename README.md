This is a very simple site I created to explore javascript dom manipulation with kinematics and physics simulations as well. 

You can check out the current site here.

Directions:

Left click on the central button in order to spawn new balls that will bounce and interact with the walls.

Press (or Hold) the spacebar to add an earthquake effects where all the balls will be sent in a random direction

Press the x button to create an "explosion" where your mouse is located that pushes nearby balls away.
